## Overview
This is a Flask web app which predicts the price of an AirBnB.

## About
The project has been designed as part of the evaluation scheme of my college course UCS757 - Building Innovative Systems. This project involves the use of Machine Learning to predict the price of an AirBnb based on the user inputs.The dataset used was https://www.kaggle.com/stevezhenghp/airbnb-price-prediction. The data is preprocessed, visualised and then fitted on two models. The RandomForestRegressor is pickled to predict the price since it gave better results. In thisw way the project has been created using the various concepts taught to us in our course curriculum.


## Deployement on Heroku
Login or signup in order to create virtual app. You can either connect your github profile or download ctl to manually deploy this project.
